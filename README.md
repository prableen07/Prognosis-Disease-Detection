# Prognosis-Disease-Detection
This project aims to predict disease prognosis using machine learning techniques based on patient symptoms and medical history. It helps identify potential health issues early, thereby aiding timely medical intervention.

## 🔬 Project Overview

- **Objective**: To develop a predictive system that classifies diseases based on symptoms provided by the user.
- **Approach**: Utilized an ensemble of machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy and reliability.
- **Outcome**: A web-based interface where users can input symptoms and receive predictions of possible diseases.

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- **Modeling**: Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, Extra Trees, LightGBM
- **Web Deployment**: Streamlit
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

- ## 🩺 How It Works

- The user selects symptoms from a list.
- The model processes the symptoms and maps them to possible diseases.
- The output includes the predicted disease and relevant confidence score.

- ##🔍 Dataset

- The dataset was sourced from Kaggle.
- The dataset contains rows of patient records, including symptoms and diagnosed diseases.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Integration with patient history and lab reports.
- Adding severity scores and medical advice.
- Expanding to multilingual support and mobile interface.
